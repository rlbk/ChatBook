# 📱 ChatBook (MERN + AWS + CI/CD + Terraform)

This is a **real-time fullstack social network application** built using modern technologies like **React (w/ TypeScript), Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, AWS, Terraform, and CircleCI**.

The project is developed by following a hands-on fullstack tutorial course. It simulates a professional engineering environment and teaches concepts from app development to cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines.
